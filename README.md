# LudumDare41-Compo
My game for the LudumDare 41 - Compo

Pythalex - April 2018


### Concept
It's a 2-players 'racing' game where each player has to avoid obstacles on the road.
The last one to remain on the road wins the game.
The game can be extended to n players, but there is surely a limit to what is fun to play and
what is just a mess.

### Game code structure
I created a UML diagram for this:

This code can be created both in OOP or PP, I just find class diagrams really cool to read.

As for this program, I chose to use full OOP instead of OOP-PP mix for better readability.
