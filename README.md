# LudumDare41-Compo
My game for the LudumDare 41 - Compo

My first LD/jam

Pythalex - April 2018


### Concept
It's a 2-players 'racing' game where each player has to avoid obstacles on the road.
The last one to remain on the road wins the game.
The game can be extended to n players, but there is surely a limit to what is fun to play and
what is just a mess.

### Game code structure
I created a UML diagram for this:

This game could be written both in OOP or PP, I just find class diagrams really cool to read.

As for this program, I chose to use full OOP instead of OOP-PP mix for better readability.

### How to run it

Assuming python3 is your primary python

in the main folder:

`python src/game.py`

Alternatively you can move resources to src/ and then from src/ 

`python game.py`
